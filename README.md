# Supply link prediction using Graph Neural Network
This is the implementation of the paper [A machine learning approach for predicting hidden links in supply chain with graph neural networks](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207543.2021.1956697) from E. E. Kosasih & A. Brintrup, 2022.

This is the final project for the course **CS276 - Machine Learning on Graphs** at SJSU.
